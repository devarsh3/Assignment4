# Installation:
- Open the Linux Terminal and go to the directory where the files are kept using the 'cd' command
- Run the '$ gcc -o Question1 Question1.c -lpthread' command to compile the file
- Run the '$ ./Question1 10 5 7 8' command to run the compiled file

# Motivation: 
The motivation behind this assignment is to apply theortical knowledge taught and apply it into a practical setting. Thus, giving us more hands on expierence when working with different operating systems along with the different concepts required to further strenghten our understanding of the topic in this case the banker's algorithm.

# Features: 
This algorithm will take into consideration requests from "n" customers for "m" resource types, if requests satisfies algorithm it will print state of the system. Uses the process of allocating resources to obtain safest sequences then to add them onto 2 dimensional array.

# Individual Contribution:

Both of us took the time to actively zoom call over the course of this assignment. We decided to split off some of the work, Devarsh decided to work on the Banker's Algorithm individually and I, Mahek decided to work on the runthread function. The rest of the functions along with the README file were done together during the zoom call over the course of the week. 

# Test Cases:

Possible Test that was used:
